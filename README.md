# Gender Recognition from Voice

## Description
"Gender Recognition from Voice" is a machine learning project that identifies a speaker's gender based on audio features. Utilizing feature extraction in R and a pre-trained XGBoost model in Python, the project offers a user-friendly graphical interface.

## Graphical User Interface (GUI)

### Option 1: Direct Execution
1. Navigate to the [`gui.py`](https://github.com/DeepNets-US/Gender-Recognition-from-Voice/blob/main/gui.py) file.
2. Run the file using your preferred Python environment.

### Option 2: Custom Models
1. Clone the entire repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DeepNets-US/Gender-Recognition-from-Voice.git
   ```
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Run the `gui.py` script.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- R (with required packages, as specified in the R script)
- Libraries: tkinter, joblib, numpy, pydub

## Usage
1. Launch the GUI using one of the options above.
2. Upload an audio file using the "Upload Audio" button.
3. Click "Detect Gender" to analyze and display the predicted gender.

## Notes
- Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the GUI.
- For R dependencies, refer to the R script and install necessary packages.
- Feel free to explore and modify the code based on your preferences.
